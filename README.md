# Huffman
A very simple implementation of Huffman encoding.

I wanted to implement the Huffman algorithm for a class. This is not an efficient implementation, nor is it perfectly functional. I wrote this as a learning experience, and I hope that someone else can learn from this.

The file encoding/decoding examples require the [bitarray python package](https://pypi.org/project/bitarray/ "Bitarray"). Install it with `python -m pip install bitarray`

This implementation is only meant to work with ASCII strings. Therefore, file encoding/decoding won't work for every file. There are also a few quirks, so please don't use this to encode important information.
